For six years , T. Marshall Hahn Jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the George Bush mode : kind and gentle .
The question now : Can he act more like hard-charging Teddy Roosevelt ?
Mr. Hahn , the 62-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of Georgia-Pacific Corp. is leading the forest-product concern 's unsolicited $ 3.19 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp .
Nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder , a reaction Mr. Hahn has n't faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions , all of which were negotiated behind the scenes .
So far , Mr. Hahn is trying to entice Nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough .
`` We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction , '' he says .
But a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war , with all that implies .
If a competitor enters the game , for example , Mr. Hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for Nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival .
Given that choice , associates of Mr. Hahn and industry observers say the former university president -- who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything -- would fold .
Says long-time associate Jerry Griffin , vice president , corporate development , at WTD Industries Inc. : `` He is n't of the old school of winning at any cost . ''
He also is a consensus manager , insiders say .
The decision to make the bid for Nekoosa , for example , was made only after all six members of Georgia-Pacific 's management committee signed onto the deal -- even though Mr. Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on , says Mr. Correll .
Associates say Mr. Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute .
Assuming that post at the age of 35 , he managed by consensus , as is the rule in universities , says Warren H. Strother , a university official who is researching a book on Mr. Hahn .
But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand .
In 1970 , Mr. Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building .
That impressed Robert B. Pamplin , Georgia-Pacific 's chief executive at the time , whom Mr. Hahn had met while fundraising for the institute .
In 1975 , Mr. Pamplin enticed Mr. Hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals ; the move befuddled many in Georgia-Pacific who did n't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world .
But Mr. Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks , demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on .
The son of a physicist , Mr. Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates .
